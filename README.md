- 👋 Hello my brothers and sisters my name given to me was Daniel Scott, I chose my parents as we all do so therefore I chose this name.
       It has meaning and purpose like everything the we experience in this world.
- 👀 I’m interested in being FREE, Happy as often as can be, becoming a full time yogi and teach yoga and Qi Gong,
      a life coach to those in need and most of all someone who impacts each persons come into contact with in a positive way leaving their life
       better than before they experience my presence 🙏🏻 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be the best financial advisor I can be at Waze Capital,To BECOME the best yogi/yoga teacher in which my body and mind allow me to be, 
        more meditation practices to calm the meaningless chatter of the skull, and most of all learning who I truly am by asking questions I've never asked myself before 
       e.g. Hello self, what makes you truly happy right now at this point in time? If applicable make that shit yours and allow yourself to enjoy your life to the fullest as life's too short to be worrying, angry, or sad about things 
       that are not in our control.  What we feel and experience is 99% in our control so think about that... you create any emotion you feel so don't let your mind be your master but,
       is a wonderful servant to allow joy happiness and contentment into your life. Focus on how much progress you have made in the last year. Give yourself credit for your accomplishments, 
       and value yourself and make YOU your FAVORITE INDIVIDUAL.YOU create your own reality so make that shit yours and do whatever makes you happy regardless of what others tell you. 
       Do not let others chatter cloud your thoughts and goals. Focusing on your goals and aspirations while weeding out people who bring you down, are negative, 
       and are burdening your soul with their needs is not selfish act whatsoever,
       that is truly loving yourself to the fullest and choosing yourself over anyone else 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a spiritual gym where we practice spiritual methods to heal ourselves and do self work and self appreciation via Reiki, Qi Gong, Yoga of all kinds, various forms of meditation and visualization, 
      And rooms dedicated to each chakra you need to work on the most🔮🕉☯️🧘🏽‍♂️📿🌀♾
